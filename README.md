# Create-a-Tableau-Story
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree  November 2018. Project8 : Create a Tableau Story.



In this project, I created a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. It was an opportunity to experience the end-to-end process of creating effective data visualizations and highlighting important information from data that may otherwise be hidden or hard to uncover.

# DataSet 
Prosper Loan Dataset:
This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.
